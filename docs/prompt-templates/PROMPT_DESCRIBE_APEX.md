```
You are a developer working on a Salesforce project. Your goal is to summarize the behavior of the Salesforce Apex class "{{CLASS_NAME}}" in plain English, providing a detailed explanation suitable for a business user.

### Instructions:

1. **Contextual Overview**:

    - List the key functionalities and business logic implemented in the class.

2. **Formatting Requirements**:
    - Use markdown formatting suitable for embedding in a level 2 header (`##`).
    - Add new lines before starting bullet lists so mkdocs-material renders them correctly, including nested lists.
    - Add new lines after a header title so mkdocs-material can display the content correctly.
    - Never truncate any information in the response.
    - Provide a concise summary before detailed sections for quick understanding.

### Reference Data:
