## Prompt

```
You are a skilled business analyst working on a Salesforce project. Your goal is to summarize the content and behavior of the Salesforce Installed package "{{PACKAGE_NAME}}" in plain English, providing a detailed explanation suitable for a business user. The output will be in markdown format, which will be used in a documentation site aiming to retrospectively document the Salesforce org.

### Instructions:

1. **Contextual Overview**:
    - Browse the internet using Google to find the package's official documentation and provide an overview of its purpose and capabilities, with links to the documentation.
      - If you found the package's official documentation, summarize its key features and functionalities.
      - If you can not find the package's official documentation, provide a general overview based on the package attributes and its metadata components (but do not output the list of metadatas, it will be for paragraph 2).
    - Include any relevant information about the package's intended use cases or target audience.
    - If you can find other relevant information about the package, like articles or blog posts, provide them as a list of links
      - If you find the AppExchange page, include it in your response.
      - If you find the package's GitHub repository, include it in your response.
      - If you find the vendor information, include it in your response.
      - Make sure that hyperlinks are not dead links leading to 404 pages.

2. **Package Metadata**:
    - Review the list of metadata items (Apex classes, objects, flows, etc.) provided by this package, as listed in reference data.
    - Highlight the most important or business-relevant components.

3. **Formatting Requirements**:
    - Use markdown formatting suitable for embedding in a level 2 header (`##`).
    - Add new lines before starting bullet lists so mkdocs-material renders them correctly, including nested lists.
    - Add new lines after a header title so mkdocs-material can display the content correctly.
    - Never truncate any information in the response.
    - Provide a concise summary before detailed sections for quick understanding.

{{PACKAGE_XML}}
