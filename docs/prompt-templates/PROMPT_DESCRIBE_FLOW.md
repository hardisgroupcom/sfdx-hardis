## How to override

To define your own prompt text, you can define a local file **config/prompt-templates/PROMPT_DESCRIBE_FLOW.txt**

You can also use the command `sf hardis:doc:override-prompts` to automatically create all override template files at once.

If you do so, please don't forget to use the replacement variables :)
