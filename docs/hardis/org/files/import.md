# hardis:org:files:import

## Description


This command facilitates the mass upload of files into Salesforce, allowing you to populate records with associated documents, images, or other file types. It's a crucial tool for data migration, content seeding, or synchronizing external file repositories with Salesforce.

Key functionalities:

- **Configuration-Driven Import:** Relies on an `export.json` file within a designated file export project (created using `sf hardis:org:configure:files`) to determine which files to import and how they should be associated with Salesforce records.
- **Interactive Project Selection:** If the file import project path is not provided via the `--path` flag, it interactively prompts the user to select one.
- **Overwrite Option:** The `--overwrite` flag allows you to replace existing files in Salesforce with local versions that have the same name. Be aware that this option doubles the number of API calls used.
- **Support for ContentVersion and Attachment:** Handles both modern Salesforce Files (ContentVersion) and older Attachments.

See this article for how to export files, which is often a prerequisite for importing:

## Technical explanations

The command's technical implementation involves:

- **FilesImporter Class:** The core logic is encapsulated within the `FilesImporter` class, which orchestrates the entire import process.
- **File System Scan:** Scans the local file system within the configured project directory to identify files for import.
- **Salesforce API Interaction:** Uses Salesforce APIs (e.g., ContentVersion, Attachment) to upload files and associate them with records.
- **Configuration Loading:** Reads the `export.json` file to get the import configuration, including SOQL queries to identify parent records for file association.
- **Interactive Prompts:** Uses `selectFilesWorkspace` to allow the user to choose a file import project and `prompts` for confirming the overwrite behavior.
- **Error Handling:** Includes mechanisms to handle potential errors during the import process, such as API limits or file upload failures.
