# hardis:org:files:export

## Description


## Command Behavior

**Exports file attachments (ContentVersion, Attachment) from a Salesforce org based on a predefined configuration.**

This command enables the mass download of files associated with Salesforce records, providing a robust solution for backing up files, migrating them to other systems, or integrating them with external document management solutions.

Key functionalities:

- **Configuration-Driven Export:** Relies on an `export.json` file within a designated file export project to define the export criteria, including the SOQL query for parent records, file types to export, and output naming conventions.
- **Interactive Project Selection:** If the file export project path is not provided via the `--path` flag, it interactively prompts the user to select one.
- **Configurable Export Options:** Allows overriding default export settings such as `chunksize` (number of records processed in a batch), `polltimeout` (timeout for Bulk API calls), and `startchunknumber` (to resume a failed export).
- **Support for ContentVersion and Attachment:** Handles both modern Salesforce Files (ContentVersion) and older Attachments.

See this article for a practical example:

<summary>Technical explanations</summary>

The command's technical implementation involves:

- **FilesExporter Class:** The core logic is encapsulated within the `FilesExporter` class, which orchestrates the entire export process.
- **SOQL Queries (Bulk API):** It uses Salesforce Bulk API queries to efficiently retrieve large volumes of parent record IDs and file metadata.
- **File Download:** Downloads the actual file content from Salesforce.
- **File System Operations:** Writes the downloaded files to the local file system, organizing them into folders based on the configured naming conventions.
- **Configuration Loading:** Reads the `export.json` file to get the export configuration. It also allows for interactive overriding of these settings.
- **Interactive Prompts:** Uses `selectFilesWorkspace` to allow the user to choose a file export project and `promptFilesExportConfiguration` for customizing export options.
- **Error Handling:** Includes mechanisms to handle potential errors during the export process, such as network issues or API limits.
