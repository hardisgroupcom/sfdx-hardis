# hardis:org:refresh:after-refresh

## Description


## Command Behavior

**Restores all previously backed-up Connected Apps (including Consumer Secrets) to a Salesforce org after a sandbox refresh.**

This command is the second step in the sandbox refresh process. It scans the backup folder created before the refresh, allows selection of which Connected Apps to restore, and automates their deletion and redeployment to the refreshed org, ensuring all credentials and configuration are preserved.

Key functionalities:

- **Backup Folder Selection:** Prompts the user to select the correct backup folder for the sandbox instance.
- **Connected App Discovery:** Scans the backup for all Connected App metadata files.
- **User Selection:** Allows interactive or flag-based selection of which Connected Apps to restore.
- **Validation:** Ensures all selected apps exist in the backup and validates user input.
- **Org Cleanup:** Deletes existing Connected Apps from the refreshed org to allow clean redeployment.
- **Deployment:** Deploys the selected Connected Apps (with secrets) to the org.
- **Summary and Reporting:** Provides a summary of restored apps and their status.

This command is part of [sfdx-hardis Sandbox Refresh](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-sandbox-refresh/) and is designed to be run after a sandbox refresh, using the backup created by the before-refresh command.
