## Description

When you assign a Permission Set to a user, and that this Permission Set is related to a Permission Set License, a Permission Set License Assignment is automatically created for the user.

  But when you unassign this Permission Set from the user, **the Permission Set License Assignment is not deleted**.

  This leads that you can be **charged for Permission Set Licenses that are not used** !

  This command detects such useless Permission Set Licenses Assignments and suggests to delete them.

  Many thanks to [Vincent Finet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentfinet/) for the inspiration during his great speaker session at [French Touch Dreamin '23](https://frenchtouchdreamin.com/), and his kind agreement for reusing such inspiration in this command :)
