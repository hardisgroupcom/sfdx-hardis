# hardis:project:generate:bypass

## Description


## Command Behavior

**Generates custom permissions and permission sets to bypass specified Salesforce automations (Flows, Triggers, and Validation Rules) for specific sObjects.**

This command provides a controlled mechanism to temporarily or permanently disable automations for certain sObjects, which is invaluable for:

- **Data Loading:** Bypassing validation rules or triggers during large data imports.
- **Troubleshooting:** Isolating automation issues by temporarily disabling them.
- **Development:** Allowing developers to work on specific sObjects without triggering complex automations.

Key functionalities:

- **sObject Selection:** You can specify a comma-separated list of sObjects to bypass (e.g., `Account,Contact`). If omitted, an interactive prompt will allow you to select from available sObjects.
- **Automation Type Selection:** Choose which types of automations to bypass: `Flow`, `Trigger`, or `VR` (Validation Rules). If omitted, an interactive prompt will guide your selection.
- **Automatic Bypass Application:** Optionally, the command can automatically inject bypass logic into Validation Rules and Triggers. This involves modifying the Apex code for Triggers and the XML for Validation Rules.
- **Metadata Source:** You can choose to retrieve the metadata elements (Validation Rules, Triggers) from the org (`--metadata-source org`) or use local files (`--metadata-source local`). Retrieving from the org is recommended for accuracy.
- **Custom Permission and Permission Set Generation:** For each selected sObject and automation type, it generates:
  - A **Custom Permission** (e.g., `BypassAccountFlows`) that acts as the bypass switch.
  - A **Permission Set** (e.g., `BypassAccountFlows`) that grants the generated Custom Permission.
- **Credits Inclusion:** By default, generated XML files include a comment indicating they were generated by sfdx-hardis. This can be skipped using `--skip-credits`.

## Technical explanations

The command's technical implementation involves:

- **SOQL Queries (Tooling API):** It queries `EntityDefinition` to list customizable sObjects and `ValidationRule` and `ApexTrigger` to find existing automations.
- **Interactive Prompts:** Uses the `prompts` library to guide the user through selecting sObjects, automation types, and bypass application options.
- **XML Generation:** Dynamically generates XML content for Custom Permissions and Permission Sets, including descriptions and labels that clearly indicate their purpose.
- **File System Operations:** Uses `fs-extra` to create directories and write the generated Custom Permission and Permission Set XML files.
- **Metadata Retrieval (for Bypass Application):** If `apply-to-vrs` or `apply-to-triggers` is used and `metadata-source` is `org`, it retrieves the relevant Validation Rule or Apex Trigger metadata from the org using `sf project retrieve start`.
- **XML/Apex Code Modification:**
  - For Validation Rules, it modifies the `errorConditionFormula` in the XML to include a check for the bypass Custom Permission.
  - For Apex Triggers, it injects an `if` statement at the beginning of the trigger body to check for the bypass Custom Permission.
- **`parseXmlFile` and `writeXmlFile`:** Used for reading and writing XML metadata files.
- **`execCommand`:** Used for executing Salesforce CLI commands, particularly for metadata retrieval.
- **Error Handling:** Includes checks for invalid sObject or automation selections and provides informative error messages.
