## Description


## Command Behavior

**Checks for missing descriptions on custom fields within your Salesforce DX project.**

This command helps enforce documentation standards by identifying custom fields that lack a descriptive explanation. Comprehensive field descriptions are crucial for:

- **Maintainability:** Making it easier for developers and administrators to understand the purpose and usage of each field.
- **Data Governance:** Ensuring data quality and consistency.
- **User Adoption:** Providing clear guidance to end-users on how to interact with fields.

It specifically targets custom fields (ending with `__c`) and excludes standard fields, managed package fields, and fields on Custom Settings or Data Cloud objects.

<summary>Technical explanations</summary>

The command's technical implementation involves:

- **File Discovery:** It uses `glob` to find all custom field metadata files (`.field-meta.xml`) within your project.
- **Custom Setting Exclusion:** It first filters out fields belonging to Custom Settings by reading the corresponding object metadata files (`.object-meta.xml`) and checking for the `<customSettingsType>` tag. It also excludes Data Cloud objects (`__dlm`, `__dll`) and managed package fields.
- **XML Parsing:** For each remaining custom field file, it reads the XML content and parses it using `xml2js` to extract the `fullName` and `description` attributes.
- **Description Check:** It verifies if the `description` attribute is present and not empty for each custom field.
- **Data Aggregation:** All custom fields found to be missing a description are collected into a list, along with their object and field names.
- **Report Generation:** It generates a CSV report (`lint-missingattributes.csv`) containing details of all fields with missing descriptions.
- **Notification Integration:** It integrates with the `NotifProvider` to send notifications (e.g., to Slack, MS Teams, Grafana) about the presence and count of fields with missing descriptions, making it suitable for automated quality checks in CI/CD pipelines.
