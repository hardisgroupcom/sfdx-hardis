## Description


## Command Behavior

**Creates a new Salesforce package (either Managed or Unlocked) in your Dev Hub.**

This command streamlines the process of setting up a new Salesforce package, which is a fundamental step for modularizing your Salesforce metadata and enabling continuous integration and delivery practices. It guides you through defining the package's essential properties.

Key functionalities:

- **Interactive Package Definition:** Prompts you for the package name, the path to its source code, and the package type (Managed or Unlocked).
- **Package Type Selection:**
  - **Managed Packages:** Ideal for AppExchange solutions, where code is hidden in subscriber orgs.
  - **Unlocked Packages:** Suitable for client projects or shared tooling, where code is readable and modifiable in subscriber orgs.
- **Package Creation:** Executes the Salesforce CLI command to create the package in your connected Dev Hub.

The command's technical implementation involves:

- **Interactive Prompts:** Uses the `prompts` library to gather necessary information from the user, such as `packageName`, `packagePath`, and `packageType`.
- **Salesforce CLI Integration:** It constructs and executes the `sf package create` command, passing the user-provided details as arguments.
- **`execSfdxJson`:** This utility is used to execute the Salesforce CLI command and capture its JSON output, which includes the newly created package's ID.
- **User Feedback:** Provides clear messages to the user about the successful creation of the package, including its ID and the associated Dev Hub.
