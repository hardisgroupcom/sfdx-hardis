# Invalid field for upsert

## Detection

- RegExp: `Error (.*) Invalid field for upsert, must be an External Id custom or standard indexed field: (.*) \((.*)\)`

## Resolution

```shell
You tried to use field {2} for an upsert call in {1}.
- Is it declared as externalId ?
- Is the customIndex source file present in the deployment ?
- If it is declared as externalId and customIndex is present, you may have to go manually define the field as externalId in the target org

```
