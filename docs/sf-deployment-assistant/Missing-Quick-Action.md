# Missing Quick Action

## Detection

## Resolution

```shell
QuickAction {2} referred in {1} is unknown. You can either:
- Make sure your QuickAction {2} is present in source files and in package.xml
- If {2} is a standard QuickAction, activate related feature in target org
- Solve other errors that could impact QuickAction {2}
- Remove QuickAction {2} in the source XML of {1}. Example of XML to remove below:
