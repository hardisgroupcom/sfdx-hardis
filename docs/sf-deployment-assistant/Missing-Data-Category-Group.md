# Missing Data Category Group

## Detection

- RegExp: `Error (.*) In field: DeveloperName - no DataCategoryGroup named (.*) found`

## Resolution

```shell
If Data Category Group {2} is not existing yet in target org, you might need to:
- create it manually in target org before deployment
- comment DataCategoryGroup in {1} XML

```
