# XML item appears more than once

## Detection

- RegExp: `Error (.*) Field:(.*), value:(.*) appears more than once`

## Resolution

```shell
You probably made an error while merging conflicts
Look for {3} in the XML of {1}
If you see two {2} XML blocks with {3}, please decide which one you keep and remove the other one
```
