## Salesforce Development

### Update code & XML Metadatas

- You can update code and XML metadatas using VsCode IDE
- When you need to upload the updates to your org, use command ![Push to org button](assets/images/btn-push-to-org.jpg)
- If you made updates directly on your org, use command ![Pull from org button](assets/images/btn-pull-from-org.jpg) to retrieve into local files the updates that you performed online with point & click
- Once you have finished, you can [publish your task](salesforce-ci-cd-publish-task.md)

### Recommendations

- Use Visual Studio code editor to update code (online Developer Console is not recommended)
