## Pr√©-requisites

You need to access to a Git repository and the url of the repository to clone.

The [release manager](salesforce-ci-cd-use.md#release-manager-guide) of the project can provide it.

It looks like the following: `https://github.com/trailheadapps/dreamhouse-lwc.git`

## Clone the repository

- In Visual Studio Code, hit **CTRL+Shirt+P** then look for command **Git clone** then click to select it.
