## Sandbox or scratch org ?

With SFDX, usually each member of the teams has its own sandbox or scratch org to work on it.

The [release manager](salesforce-ci-cd-release-home.md) of the project can tell you if you work with [**scratch orgs**](#scratch-org-mode) or [**source-tracked sandboxes**](#source-tracked-sandbox-mode), and **which sandbox to use if you are in sandbox mode**.

## Source-tracked sandbox mode

### Pre-requisites (sandbox)

You need credentials to login on the source-tracked sandbox you'll work with. It can be:

- An **existing source-tracked sandbox**
  - Existing source-tracked sandboxes must be **refreshed from time to time to avoid too many conflicts**, discuss with your Release Manager !
- A **new source-tracked sandbox** that you can create from production org

It is recommended to create sandbox from the org that is related to the target git branch.
