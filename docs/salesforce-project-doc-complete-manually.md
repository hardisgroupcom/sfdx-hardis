## Manually complete documentation

sfdx-hardis generated a brand new doc using Metadata and AI enhancements.

But maybe you would like to complete it manually ?

We got you covered, with 3 ways to manually update generated doc and even create your own pages !

### Overwrite AI-generated parts

In the generated markdown files in `docs` folder and sub folders, you will see HTML comments around AI-generated text, like below

```markdown
<!-- The following part has been generated by AI. -->
<!-- If you want to override it manually, rename the cache file into docs/cache-ai-results/fr-PROMPT_DESCRIBE_FLOW-Opportunity_AfterInsert.md then update it with the content you want. -->
<!-- Cache file start: docs/cache-ai-results/fr-PROMPT_DESCRIBE_FLOW-Opportunity_AfterInsert-2527848841.md -->

## Describe flow Opportunity_AfterInsert

Some summary generated by calls to LLMs
...

<!-- Cache file end: docs/cache-ai-results/fr-PROMPT_DESCRIBE_FLOW-Opportunity_AfterInsert-2527848841.md -->
```

It tells you which file you have to rename and how.

Just rename the file `fr-PROMPT_DESCRIBE_FLOW-Opportunity_AfterInsert-2527848841.md` as `fr-PROMPT_DESCRIBE_FLOW-Opportunity_AfterInsert.md`, update the content, generate doc again, and you're all set !

Example result:

```markdown
<!-- The following part has been generated by AI then manually updated -->
<!-- If you want AI to recalculate it again, you can delete file docs/cache-ai-results/fr-PROMPT_DESCRIBE_FLOW-Opportunity_AfterInsert.md -->
<!-- Cache file: docs/cache-ai-results/fr-PROMPT_DESCRIBE_FLOW-Opportunity_AfterInsert.md -->

## Describe flow Opportunity_AfterInsert

Your own text here !
...

<!-- Cache file end: docs/cache-ai-results/fr-PROMPT_DESCRIBE_FLOW-Opportunity_AfterInsert.md -->
```

### Overwrite the whole file

At the beginning of generated markdown files, you will see comments like below.

```markdown
<!-- This file is auto-generated. if you do not want it to be overwritten, set TRUE in the line below -->
<!-- DO_NOT_OVERWRITE_DOC=FALSE -->

Some sfdx-hardis generated content text
...
```

Update the comment to define `<!-- DO_NOT_OVERWRITE_DOC=TRUE -->`, then update the documentation with your own text, then you're all set !

```markdown
<!-- This file is auto-generated. if you do not want it to be overwritten, set TRUE in the line below -->
<!-- DO_NOT_OVERWRITE_DOC=TRUE -->

My own documentation !
...
```

Note: AI-generated parts won't be calculated anymore if you define `<!-- DO_NOT_OVERWRITE_DOC=TRUE -->`.

### Add your own pages

Create markdown files in **docs** folder.

Example: `docs/my-custom-doc-page.md`

To add a link to your markdown pages in the menu, update **nav** section of file **mkdocs.yml**.

Example:

```yaml
  - Branches & Orgs: sfdx-hardis-branches-and-orgs.md
  - Installed Packages: installed-packages.md
  - My Custom menu:
      My Custom Page: my-custom-doc-page.md
```
