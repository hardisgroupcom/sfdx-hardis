## Commit your updates

_The following video shows how to perform theses operations_

### Retrieve metadatas

If you made updates on your org that you have not pulled yet, Use command ![Pull from org button](assets/images/btn-pull-from-org.jpg) to **pull your latest updates in local files**

If you updated config elements that you do not see in your local files, you may discuss with your release manager to [automate force retrieve metadatas](salesforce-ci-cd-retrieve.md)

#### Alternative: Use Org Browser

You can also use Salesforce extension Org Browser to manually browse and retrieve specific metadatas

![](assets/images/screenshot-org-browser.png)

#### Alternative: Use contextual menu

If Org Browser does not see items that you want to retrieve, like list views, you can right click on any **listViews** folder and use command **SFDX: Retrieve source from org**

#### Alternative: Use menu "Select and retrieve"

If it is not possible to use pull configuration, you may retrieve metadatas using ![Select and retrieve button](assets/images/btn-select-retrieve.jpg) (but it will retrieve locally many files and it will be harder to select the ones you really need, select carefully the items that you stage and commit)

### Stage and commit

In VsCode Git extension, **stage** and **commit** created, updated and deleted files that you want to publish

- By selecting the metadata files you can **see the differences** with the previous versions, to know if you want to publish or not an updated file

- **Never use Stage all function**

- If you see standard items like standard fields that do not contain customizations, do not commit them

- **Important**: If you think that your sandbox may not be up to date according to elements published by your colleagues, look closely at the diff on those items, and stage only the updates that you want to publish

## Prepare merge request

- **Once your commit is completed**, run command ![Save / publish my current task button](assets/images/btn-save-publish-task.jpg) to prepare your merge request.

- As you committed your files like explained in the previous section, select option ![Message my commit is ready](assets/images/msg-commit-ready.jpg) when prompted.

- Wait for the script to complete, and select **Push commit to server** when prompted

> ![Under the hood](assets/images/engine.png) **_Under the hood_**
>
> The script performs the following operations:
>
> - Update `manifest/package.xml` automatically according to the committed updates
> - Clean XML of metadatas according to .sfdx-hardis.yml config property `autoCleanTypes` and `autoRemoveUserPermissions`
> - New git commit with automated updates
> - Git push commit to git server
>

## Create merge request

It is now time to create your merge request to technically publish your updates at the upper level !

Depending on the CI platform you use, follow the related guide.

_**Important**: If you are **publishing to a RUN branch** (ex: `preprod`), **AND** the **project also has a BUILD branch** (ex: `integration`), you need to create **2 merge requests**:_

- _One from your feature or fix branch with the BUILD branch as target_
- _One from your feature or fix branch with the RUN branch as target_

### Using Gitlab

See [Create a merge request using Gitlab](salesforce-ci-cd-merge-request-gitlab.md)

### Using Azure

See [Create a merge request using Azure](salesforce-ci-cd-pull-request-azure.md)

### Using GitHub

See [Create a merge request using Github](salesforce-ci-cd-pull-request-github.md)

## Check merge request results

After you create your merge request, [check its control jobs results](salesforce-ci-cd-handle-merge-request-results.md) !
