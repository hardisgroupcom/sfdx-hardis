## BUILD & RUN

Except for projects in maintenance that contain RUN only, a project is separated into 2 sections: the BUILD and the RUN

### THE BUILD

This is the layer where you prepare the **next major or minor version**.

Such new features will go through **integration level**, then **uat level** where they will be **qualified and validated by business users**.

When the User Acceptance Test will be validated in **uat org**, then **uat can be merged into preprod**, and just after minimal tests (mostly technical), **preprod will soon be merged into production**.

Is it important that **major features or enhancements are not tested directly at preprod level**, because while the next version is being validated in preprod, it is **not possible for the RUN to deploy anything into production**.

### THE RUN

Daily maintenance of the production Salesforce org must be very reactive, the RUN level will allow you to **deploy patch versions**.

As we usually can not wait for the next minor or major version to be deployed in production, projects need a way to quickly deploy hot fixes into production. That layer is called the RUN, and is exclusively about **preprod** and **production branches**.

To summarize, you will **publish at RUN level, but also at BUILD level**, so when the BUILD will be merged in the RUN, **there will be no overwrite triggering regressions**.

The **hotfix process** is the following:

- IMPLEMENT **HOTFIX** _**(1)**_

  - Create new task with **preprod as target when prompted**, named `my-very-hot-hotfix` for example

  - Work on a dev sandbox that has been cloned from production

- DEPLOYMENT IN **RUN LAYER** _**(2)**_

  - Create Pull Request from `my-very-hot-hotfix` to `preprod` & merge it after controls (do not select “delete after merge” )

  - Create Pull request from `preprod` to `production`

  - Merge `preprod` to `production` after control checks are green.

- RETROFIT IN **BUILD LAYER** _**(3)**_

  - Create Pull Request from `my-very-hot-hotfix` to `integration` & merge it after controls

  - If there are issues (conflicts…), you can solve them directly in  my-very-hot-hotfix then complete your retrofit PR to integration
