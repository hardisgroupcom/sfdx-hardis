## Introduction

You can setup and use a full CI/CD pipeline for your Salesforce projects using sfdx-hardis.

We provide a [gitlab CI default template](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/.gitlab-ci.yml), but its can easily be adapted to other platforms like [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/devops/pipelines/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)...

If you speak fluently **git**, **sfdx** & **DevOps**, you can be fully autonomous to setup and use Salesforce CI/CD, otherwise you can contact us at [**Cloudity**](https://cloudity.com/) and we'll be glad to assist you :)

_Here is an advanced example of a Salesforce CI/CD Pipeline that you can easily define using sfdx-hardis._
_You can define much simpler branch/orgs models, to manage only RUN operations_
