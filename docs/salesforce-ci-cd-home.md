## Why choosing sfdx-hardis ?

There are many ways to do DevOps with Salesforce, each of them have their advantages and inconveniences, like showed in the following comparison table.

### Because it is user friendly

![DevOps Pipeline](assets/images/sfdx-hardis-pipeline-view.gif)

- **Admins** are autonomous to [build their pull requests](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-ci-cd-publish-task/) **with clicks in VsCode Extension, no command lines**
- **Developers** understand what's happening under the hood with SF CLI thanks to the **Advanced mode** of the User Interface
- **Release Managers** can easily configure the CI/CD process using the **Visual DevOps Pipeline Builder**
- **Project Managers** can easily follow the Application Lifecycle Management on the project using sfdx-hardis native integration with Ticketing systems like JIRA and Azure Boards.

### Because it is powerful

More advanced features are making sfdx-hardis a credible alternative to expensive SF DevOps vendor tools:

- [**Delta Deployments**](salesforce-ci-cd-config-delta-deployment.md): Improve performances by deploying only updated metadatas
- [**Overwrite Management**](salesforce-ci-cd-config-overwrite.md): Define which metadatas will never be overwritten if they are already existing in the target org of a deployment
- [**Smart Apex Test Runs**](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/hardis/project/deploy/smart/#smart-deployments-tests): If your Pull Request to a sandbox can not break Apex Tests, just don't run them to improve performances.
- [**Automated sources cleaning**](salesforce-ci-cd-config-cleaning.md): Clean profiles from attributes existing on permission sets, clean flow positions...
- [**Integration with Messaging platforms**](salesforce-ci-cd-setup-integrations-home.md): Receive detailed deployment notifications on **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams** and Emails
- Integration with **ticketing systems**: [**JIRA**](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-ci-cd-setup-integration-jira/), [**Azure Boards**](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-ci-cd-setup-integration-azure-boards/), or [any other tool](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-ci-cd-setup-integration-generic-ticketing/)
- [**Integration with AI**](salesforce-deployment-assistant-home.md) to easily solve Deployment issues (use Agentforce, or direct calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini...)

We provide **ready to use CI/CD pipeline workflows** for the following Git platforms, with results of Deployment simulation jobs as comments on Pull Requests:

- [Gitlab](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/.gitlab-ci.yml)
- [Azure](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/azure-pipelines-checks.yml)
- [Github & Gitea](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- [BitBucket](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/bitbucket-pipelines.yml)
- [Jenkins](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/Jenkinsfile)

Pipelines can easily be adapted to other platforms like [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)

_Here is an advanced example of a Salesforce CI/CD Pipeline that you can easily define using sfdx-hardis._
_You can define much simpler branch/orgs models, to manage only RUN operations._

### Because there are no licences costs

As everything is **open-source**, there is **no license costs** !

> In comparison, many Salesforce DevOps tools vendors charge more than 250â‚¬/user/month per contributor user.

You can handle everything on your own, or ask [**Cloudity**](https://cloudity.com/) Professional Services for support.

### Because it is widely adopted

Sfdx-hardis CI/CD is used in production by major companies all around the world.
