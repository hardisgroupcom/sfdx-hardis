## Introduction

There are many ways to do DevOps with Salesforce, each of them have their advantages and inconveniences, like showed in the following comparison table.

You can setup and use a full CI/CD pipeline for your Salesforce projects using sfdx-hardis.

We provide [Gitlab](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/.gitlab-ci.yml) & [Azure](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/azure-pipelines-checks.yml) pipelines, and they can easily be adapted to other platforms like [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)...

If you speak fluently **git**, **sfdx** & **DevOps**, you can be fully autonomous to setup and use Salesforce CI/CD, otherwise you can contact us at [**Cloudity**](https://cloudity.com/) (or your favorite Salesforce integrator) and we'll be glad to assist you :)

As everything is **open-source**, there is **no license costs** !

_Here is an advanced example of a Salesforce CI/CD Pipeline that you can easily define using sfdx-hardis._
_You can define much simpler branch/orgs models, to manage only RUN operations._
