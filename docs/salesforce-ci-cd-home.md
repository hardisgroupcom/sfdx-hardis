## Why choose sfdx-hardis?

There are many ways to do DevOps with Salesforce. Each has its advantages and limitations, as shown in the following comparison table.

### Because it is user-friendly

![DevOps Pipeline](assets/images/sfdx-hardis-pipeline-view.gif)

- **Admins** can [build their pull requests](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-ci-cd-publish-task/) using the **VS Code extension** with clicks, no command line required.
- **Developers** understand what's happening under the hood with the **Salesforce CLI**, thanks to the **Advanced mode** in the UI.
- **Release Managers** can configure the CI/CD process using the **Visual DevOps Pipeline Builder**.
- **Project Managers** can follow application lifecycle management using sfdx-hardis **native integrations** with ticketing systems like **Jira** and **Azure Boards**.

### Because it is powerful

Advanced features make sfdx-hardis a credible alternative to expensive Salesforce DevOps tools:

- [**Delta Deployments**](salesforce-ci-cd-config-delta-deployment.md): Improve performance by deploying only updated metadata.
- [**Overwrite Management**](salesforce-ci-cd-config-overwrite.md): Define which metadata will never be overwritten if it already exists in the target org.
- [**Smart Apex Test Runs**](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/hardis/project/deploy/smart/#smart-deployments-tests): If your pull request to a sandbox cannot break Apex tests, skip them to improve performance.
- [**Automated source cleaning**](salesforce-ci-cd-config-cleaning.md): Clean profiles of attributes that exist in permission sets, tidy flow element positions, and more.
- [**Integration with messaging platforms**](salesforce-ci-cd-setup-integrations-home.md): Receive detailed deployment notifications on **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, and email.
- Integration with **ticketing systems**: [**Jira**](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-ci-cd-setup-integration-jira/), [**Azure Boards**](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-ci-cd-setup-integration-azure-boards/), or [any other tool](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-ci-cd-setup-integration-generic-ticketing/).
- [**AI integration**](salesforce-deployment-assistant-home.md) to help resolve deployment issues (use Agentforce or direct calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).

We provide **ready-to-use CI/CD pipeline workflows** for the following Git platforms, with the results of deployment simulation jobs posted as comments on pull requests:

- [GitLab](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/.gitlab-ci.yml)
- [Azure](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/azure-pipelines-checks.yml)
- [GitHub & Gitea](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- [Bitbucket](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/bitbucket-pipelines.yml)
- [Jenkins](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/defaults/ci/Jenkinsfile)

Pipelines can easily be adapted to other platforms like [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/).

_Here is an advanced example of a Salesforce CI/CD pipeline that you can define using sfdx-hardis._
_You can define much simpler branch/org models to manage only RUN operations._

### Because there are no license costs

As everything is **open source**, there are **no license costs**!

> In comparison, many Salesforce DevOps vendors charge more than 250â‚¬/user/month per contributor.

You can handle everything yourself, or ask [**Cloudity**](https://cloudity.com/) Professional Services for support.
