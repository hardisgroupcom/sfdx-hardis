## Jira integration

_This feature is currently in beta but can already be used safely !_

If you use JIRA on your project, sfdx-hardis can use it to enrich its integrations.

The only thing you have to make sure is to **use the full URL of JIRA tickets** in your commits and PR/MR descriptions.

> Use `https://sfdx-hardis.atlassian.net/browse/CLOUDITY-4` , not `CLOUDITY-4` !
