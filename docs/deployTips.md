Example:

![Deployment Tip example](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/raw/main/docs/assets/images/deploy-tip-example.jpg)

## API Version error

- `Error (.*) The (.*) apiVersion can't be "([0-9]+)"`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
{1} metadata has probably been created/updated in a sandbox already upgraded to next platform version (ex: Sandbox in Summer'23 and Production in Spring'23)
- First, try to update the api version in the XML of {1} metadata file (decrement the number in <apiVersion>{3}.0</apiVersion>)
- If it still doesn't work because the metadata structure has changed between version, you may try a force:source:retrieve of the metadata by forcing --apiversion at the end of the command.
      
```

## Allow deployment with pending Apex Jobs

- `You can bypass this error by allowing deployments with Apex jobs in the Deployment Settings page in Setup.`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
Go to target org, in Setup -> Deployment Settings -> Activate option "Allow deployments of components when corresponding Apex jobs are pending or in progress."

```

## Can not change field type to a formula field

- `Error (.*) Cannot update a field from a Formula to something else`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You need to manually delete or rename the field in the target org to allow the deployment to pass
- First, try to manually delete field {1} in the target org
- if you can't delete {1}, rename it into {1}_ToDel, then once the deployment done, delete {1}_ToDel
```

## Can not change type due to existing data

- `Error (.*) Cannot change type due to existing data`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
It is usually not recommended to change types of fields, but if it's really necessary you can:
- Manually change the type of {1} in the target org
- If you can't manually change the type:
  - you may modify the dependencies (Formulas, Flows...) using {1}, so they don't use this field
  - you can also delete dependencies (Formulas, Flows...) using {1}, but make sure they are deployed again later
- More help: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000327186&type=1
```

## Can not change field type with picklist

- `Error (.*) Cannot change which global value set this picklist uses`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You probably updated the type of field {1}, and Salesforce does not allows that with deployments. You can:
- Try to manually change the type of {1} directly in target org, but it may not be technically possible
- Delete field {1} in target org: it will be recreated after deployment (but you will loose data on existing records, so be careful if your target is a production org)
- Create another field with desired type and manage data recovery if the target is a production org
```

## Can not delete custom field

- `This (.*) is referenced elsewhere in salesforce.com`
- `Le champ personnalisé (.*) est utilisé dans (.*)`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
Custom field {1} can not be deleted because it is used elsewhere. Remove its references ans try again
THIS MAY BE A FALSE POSITIVE if you are just testing the deployment, as destructiveChanges are deployed separately from updated items deployment check
```

## Can not delete record type

- `Error (.*) Cannot delete record type through API`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You need to manually delete record type {1} in target org
- Edit record type {1}, uncheck "Active"
- Delete record type {1}
```

## Can not find folder

- `Error (.*) Cannot find folder:(.*)`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
Folder {2} is missing.
- If folder {2} is existing in sources, add it in related package.xml
- If folder {2} is not existing in DX sources, please use sfdx hardis:project:clean:retrievefolders to retrieve it
- If both previous solutions did not work, go create manually folder {2} in target org

```

## Can not find user

- `Error (.*) Cannot find a user that matches any of the following usernames`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You made reference to username(s) in {1}, and those users probably do not exist in target org.
- Do not use named users, but user public groups for assignments -> https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.creating_and_editing_groups.htm&type=5
- or Create matching user(s) in the target deployment org
- or Remove the XML part referring to hardcoded usernames

Example of XML you have to remove in {1}:

<folderShares>
  <accessLevel>Manage</accessLevel>
  <sharedTo>nicolas.vuillamy@hardis-scratch-po-tgci-root-develop_20220412_0604.com</sharedTo>
  <sharedToType>User</sharedToType>
</folderShares>
```

## Can not find user (2)

- `Error (.*) In field: (.*) - no User named (.*) found`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You made reference to username {3} in {1}, and it probably does not exist in the target org.
- Do not use named users, but user public groups for assignments -> https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.creating_and_editing_groups.htm&type=5
- or Create matching user {3} in the target deployment org
- or open {1} metadata and remove the XML part referring to hardcoded username {3}
```

## Cannot update a field to a Summary from something else

- `Error (.*) Cannot update a field to a (.*) from something else`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You probably updated the type of field {1} to type {2}, and Salesforce does not allows that with deployments. You can:
- Try to manually change the type of {1} directly in target org, but it may not be technically possible
- Delete field {1} in target org: it will be recreated after deployment (but you will loose data on existing records, so be careful if your target is a production org)
- Create another field with desired type and manage data recovery if the target is a production org
```

## Custom object not found

- `Error (.*) In field: field - no CustomObject named (.*) found`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
A reference to a custom object {2} is not found in {1}:
- If you renamed the custom object, do a search/replace in sources with previous object name and new object name
- If you deleted the custom object, or if you don't want to deploy it, do a search on the custom object name, and remove XML elements referencing it
- If the object should exist, make sure it is in force-app/main/default/objects and that the object name is in manifest/package.xml in CustomObject section
You may also have a look to command sfdx hardis:project:clean:references

```

## Custom field not found

- `Error (.*) In field: (.*) - no CustomField named (.*)\.(.*) found`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
A reference to a custom field {3}.{4} is not found in {1}:
- If you renamed {3}.{4}, do a search/replace in {1} with previous field name and {4}
- If you deleted {3}.{4}, or if you don't want to deploy it, do a search on {4} in all sources, and remove all XML elements referring to {3}.{4} (except in destructiveChanges.xml)
- If {3}.{4} should exist, make sure it is in force-app/main/default/objects/{3}/fields and that {3}.{4} is in manifest/package.xml in CustomField section
- If {3}.{4} is standard, the error is because {3}.{4} is not available in the org you are trying to deploy to. You can:
  - Remove the reference to {4} in the XML of {1} ( maybe sfdx hardis:project:clean:references can clean automatically for you ! )
  - Activate the required features/license in the target org

```

## Mandatory custom field can not be in a profile/permission set

- `Error (.*) You cannot deploy to a required field: (.*)`

**Resolution tip**

```shell

- Search for {2} in source file XML of {1}, then remove the entries matching the results
Example of element to delete:
<fieldPermissions>
  <editable>true</editable>
  <field>{2}</field>
  <readable>true</readable>
</fieldPermissions>

```

## Custom metadata entry not found

- `Error (.*) In field: (.*) - no CustomMetadata named (.*) found`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
A reference to a custom metadata {3} of type {2} is not found in {1}:
- Are you sure you deployed {3} ?
- If you use a package.xml, is {3} present within type CustomMetadata ?

```

## Dependent class is invalid and needs recompilation

- `Error (.*) Dependent class is invalid and needs recompilation`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
Solve the other errors and this one will disappear !

```

## Duplicate value Platform Action Id List

- `duplicate value found: PlatformActionListId duplicates value on record with id`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
There are probably issue with conflict management. Open the XML of the source item, and replace all <sortOrder> numbers to make an ascending order, starting with 0
```

## Duplicate label

- `Error (.*) Duplicate label: (.*)`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You probably renamed the picklist API name for {2}. Please update manually the picklist {1} in the target org to avoid to have a duplicate label
```

## Missing e-mail template

- `In field: template - no EmailTemplate named (.*) found`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
An email template should be present in the sources. To retrieve it, you can run:
sfdx force:source:retrieve -m EmailTemplate:{1} -u YOUR_ORG_USERNAME
```

## Empty source items

- `Required field is missing: sharingOwnerRules`
- `Required field is missing: standardValue`
- `Required field is missing: valueTranslation`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You probably retrieved empty items, that must not be included within the SFDX project
To remove them, please run sfdx:hardis:project:clean:emptyitems
```

## Enable CRM Analytics

- `It should be created by enabling the CRM Analytics Cloud preference`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You must enable CRM Analytics (ex Wave, Einstein Analytics & Tableau CRM) in the target org.
You probably also need to add CRM Analytics Admin Permission Set assignment to the deployment user
```

## Error parsing file

- `Error (.*) Error parsing file: (.*)`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
There has been an error parsing the XML file of {1}: {2}
- Open file {1} and look where the error can be ! (merge issue, typo, XML tag not closed...)
```

## Formula picklist field issue

- `Field:(.*) must not be Required`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
You probably made read only field {1} that was required before.
Find field {1} in the layout source XML, then replace Required by Readonly
```

## Field not available for element

- `Field (.*) is not available for`

**Resolution tip**

```shell

- Make sure that sfdx sources {1}.object-meta.xml and {4}.object-meta.xml and in the files, and that {1} and {4} are in package.xml in CustomObject block
- You may directly update sharingModel in XML. For example, replace <sharingModel>ReadWrite</sharingModel> by <sharingModel>Private</sharingModel> in {3}.object-meta.xml

```

## Picklist sharing is not supported

- `Picklist sharing is not supported`

**Resolution tip**

```

## CRM Analytics: A Recipe must specify a DataFlow

- `Error (.*) A Recipe must specify a Dataflow`

**Resolution tip**

```

## Objects rights on a role is below org default

- `access level below organization default`

**Resolution tip**

```shell
Your org wide settings default must be lower than the level defined in roles:
- If you are in a scratch org, it can be fixable using "objectProperties" in project-scratch-def.json (see "Set Object-Level Sharing Settings" paragraph in page https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_scratch_orgs_def_file.htm)
- If you are in a sandbox/dev/prod org, you need to update default org wide settings before deployment. See https://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/organization-wide-defaults-owd-in-salesforce/
            
```

## Unsupported sharing configuration

- `not supported for (.*) since it's org wide default is`

Please check https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/260923/sfdx-deploying-contact-sharing-rules-on-a-fresh-deployment
If you already did that, please try again to run the job
```

```shell
Are you sure you need this sharing rule ? You may remove it from the sfdx project
```

## Sharing recalculation lock

- `because it interferes with another operation already in progress`
- `Le calcul de partage demandé ne peut être traité maintenant car il interfère avec une autre opération en cours`
