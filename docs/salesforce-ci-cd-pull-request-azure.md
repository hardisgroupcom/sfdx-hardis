- Click on **Create**

- Controlling jobs are automatically launched, you can now ask your release manager to [**validate the merge request**](salesforce-ci-cd-validate-merge-request.md)
  - _If you are a developer, (or even a business consultant depending on the project organization), you may have the responsibility to make sure than controlling jobs are valid (**check-deploy job** and **code-quality job** in **success**) and eventually fix the errors (See [Handle merge requests errors](salesforce-ci-cd-handle-merge-request-results.md))_

- If you need to add additional updates to an existing merge requests, you just this to follow again [this guide](salesforce-ci-cd-publish-task.md) from the beginning, except the part "Create a merge request". Any new commit pushed on a branch where there is already a merge request will trigger again the [control jobs](salesforce-ci-cd-validate-merge-request.md#control-jobs).
