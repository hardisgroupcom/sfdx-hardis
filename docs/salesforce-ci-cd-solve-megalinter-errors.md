## Apex best practices using PMD

You don't want technical debt on your project !

Download job artifacts that will contain a file `sfdx-scanner-report-apex.csv`.

Open the file to see the errors

- If the errors are in code that has been written by a developer, solve it

- If the errors are from imported or generated classes, you can bypass them by adding annotation `@SuppressWarnings('PMD')` at the top of the classes

- `// NOPMD` at the end of a line will make an issue ignored, but again use it only in case of false positive, never to "Publish more quickly", else you'll create [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).
  - If you use `// NOPMD`, specify why as comment . Example: `// NOPMD Strings already escaped before`

## LWC best practices using eslint

sfdx-scanner-lwc embedded in MegaLinter is hard to use.

If you don't succeed, you can define `SALESFORCE_SFDX_SCANNER_LWC` in `DISABLE_LINTERS` property in `.mega-linter.yml` config file.

## Security issues

Solve the security issues if they are critical like hardcoded tokens, or bypass the linters (release manager action only)

## Excessive copy-pastes

Refactor your code to avoid excessive copy-pastes !

You can also add exceptions in `.jscpd.json` file, but really in case it has sense, not out of laziness

## Example of .mega-linter.yml config file

```yaml
# Extend from shared sfdx-hardis Mega-Linter configuration :)
EXTENDS:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/main/config/sfdx-hardis.mega-linter-config.yml

DISABLE_LINTERS:
- SALESFORCE_SFDX_SCANNER_LWC
- SALESFORCE_SFDX_SCANNER_AURA
- CSS_STYLELINT

SALESFORCE_SFDX_SCANNER_APEX_DISABLE_ERRORS_IF_LESS_THAN: 6 # ONLY THE RELEASE MANAGER CAN UPDATE THIS VALUE !
```
