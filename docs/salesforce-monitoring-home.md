## Monitor your Salesforce org with sfdx-hardis

> This feature worked yesterday in production, but today it crashes, what happened ?

Salesforce provide **Audit Trail** to trace configuration updates in **production** or **sandbox** orgs.

You can **know who updated what**, but not with details (before / after).

Sfdx-hardis monitoring provides a **simple way to know the exact state of your orgs metadatas everyday**, or even several times a day, and provides an **exact and detailed comparison with the previous metadata configuration** (using git commits comparison)

Installation and usage are **admin-friendly**, and **notifications** can be sent via **Slack** or **Microsoft Teams**.

Extra features are also available, like:

- Run **apex tests** (and soon flow tests)
- Analyze the **quality and the security of your metadatas** with [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/latest/)
- Check if you have [**deprecated api versions called**](https://nicolas.vuillamy.fr/handle-salesforce-api-versions-deprecation-like-a-pro-335065f52238)
- **Custom command lines** that you can [define in `.sfdx-hardis.yml`](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/hardis/org/monitor/all/)

You don't need to work in CI/CD to use Monitoring, it is **compliant with any API enabled org** :)

## How does it work ?

Every night (or even more frequently, according to your schedule), a CI job will be triggered.

It will **extract all the metadatas of your org**, then push a **new commit in the monitoring repository** in case there are updates since the latest metadata backup.

The **list of updated metadatas** will be sent via notification to a **Slack and/or Microsoft Teams channel**.

After the metadata backup, other jobs will be triggered (Apex tests, Code Quality, Legacy API checks + your own commands), and their results will be stored in job artifacts and sent via notifications.

## All Monitoring Commands

The following checks are active out of the box.

In order to avoid to overflow channels of notifications, some commands are run everyday whereas less critical ones are run weekly (on saturday).

You can force the daily run of all commands by defining env var `MONITORING_IGNORE_FREQUENCY=true`.
