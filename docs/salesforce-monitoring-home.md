## Monitor your Salesforce org with sfdx-hardis

> This feature worked yesterday in production, but today it crashes, what happened ?

Salesforce provide **Audit Trail** to trace configuration updates in **production** or **sandbox** orgs.

You can **know who updated what**, but not with details (before / after).

Sfdx-hardis monitoring provides a **simple way to know the exact state of your orgs metadatas everyday**, or even several times a day, and provides an **exact and detailed comparison with the previous metadata configuration** (using git commits comparison)

Installation and usage are **admin-friendly**, and **notifications** can be sent via **Slack** or **Microsoft Teams**.

_Example of a monitoring git repository_

_Example notifications with Slack_

Extra features are also available, like:

- Run **apex tests** (and soon flow tests)
- Analyze the **quality and the security of your metadatas** with [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/latest/)
- Check if you have [**deprecated api versions called**](https://nicolas.vuillamy.fr/handle-salesforce-api-versions-deprecation-like-a-pro-335065f52238)
- **Custom command lines** that you can [define in `.sfdx-hardis.yml`](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/hardis/org/monitor/all/)

You don't need to work in CI/CD to use Monitoring, it is **compliant with any API enabled org** :)

## How does it work ?

Every night (or even more frequently, according to your schedule), a CI job will be triggered.

It will **extract all the metadatas of your org**, then push a **new commit in the monitoring repository** in case there are updates since the latest metadata backup.

_Example workflow with GitHub actions_

_Example diff visualization with GitLens_

The **list of updated metadatas** will be sent via notification to a **Slack and/or Microsoft Teams channel**.

After the metadata backup, other jobs will be triggered (Apex tests, Code Quality, Legacy API checks + your own commands), and their results will be stored in job artifacts and sent via notifications.
