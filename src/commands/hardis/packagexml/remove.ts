## Command Behavior

**Removes metadata components from a \`package.xml\` file that are also present in another \`package.xml\` file (e.g., a \`destructiveChanges.xml\`).**

This command is useful for refining your \`package.xml\` manifests by excluding components that are being deleted or are otherwise irrelevant for a specific deployment or retrieval. For example, you can use it to create a \`package.xml\` that only contains additions and modifications, by removing items listed in a \`destructiveChanges.xml\`.

Key functionalities:

- **Source \`package.xml\`:** The main \`package.xml\` file from which components will be removed (specified by \`--packagexml\`). Defaults to \`package.xml\`.
- **Filter \`package.xml\`:** The \`package.xml\` file containing the components to be removed from the source (specified by \`--removepackagexml\`). Defaults to \`destructiveChanges.xml\`.
- **Output File:** The path to the new \`package.xml\` file that will contain the filtered content (specified by \`--outputfile\`).
- **Removed Only Output:** The \`--removedonly\` flag allows you to generate a \`package.xml\` that contains *only* the items that were removed from the source \`package.xml\`.

## Technical explanations

The command's technical implementation involves:

- **File Parsing:** It reads and parses the XML content of both the source \`package.xml\` and the filter \`package.xml\`.
- **Content Comparison and Filtering:** It compares the metadata types and members defined in both files. Components found in the filter \`package.xml\` are excluded from the output.
- **XML Building:** After filtering, it rebuilds the XML structure for the new \`package.xml\` file.
- **File Writing:** The newly constructed XML content is then written to the specified output file.
- **\`removePackageXmlFilesContent\` Utility:** The core logic for this operation is encapsulated within the \`removePackageXmlFilesContent\` utility function, which handles the parsing, filtering, and writing of the \`package.xml\` files.
