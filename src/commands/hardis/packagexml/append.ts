## Command Behavior

**Appends the content of one or more Salesforce \`package.xml\` files into a single target \`package.xml\` file.**

This command is useful for consolidating metadata definitions from various sources into a single manifest. For instance, you might have separate \`package.xml\` files for different features or metadata types, and this command allows you to combine them into one comprehensive file for deployment or retrieval.

Key functionalities:

- **Multiple Input Files:** Takes a comma-separated list of \`package.xml\` file paths as input.
- **Single Output File:** Merges the content of all input files into a specified output \`package.xml\` file.
- **Metadata Consolidation:** Combines the \`<types>\` and \`<members>\` elements from all input files, ensuring that all unique metadata components are included in the resulting file.

## Technical explanations

The command's technical implementation involves:

- **File Parsing:** It reads and parses the XML content of each input \`package.xml\` file.
- **Content Merging:** It iterates through the parsed XML structures, merging the \`types\` and \`members\` arrays. If a metadata type exists in multiple input files, its members are combined (duplicates are typically handled by the underlying XML utility).
- **XML Building:** After consolidating the metadata, it rebuilds the XML structure for the output \`package.xml\` file.
- **File Writing:** The newly constructed XML content is then written to the specified output file.
- **\`appendPackageXmlFilesContent\` Utility:** The core logic for this operation is encapsulated within the \`appendPackageXmlFilesContent\` utility function, which handles the parsing, merging, and writing of the \`package.xml\` files.
